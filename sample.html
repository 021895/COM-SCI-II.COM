<b>CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK</b>

<p><mark>Creative Technologies</mark> is a contextualized Technology and Livelihood Education (TLE) subject for stand-alone science high schools 
such as the Regional Science High School and the Legislated Science High School. Students in these schools are known to be mathematically
 and scientifically-inclined hence the topics included in this curriculum not only meet their interest and intellectually capacity, 
but also aim to support the research that these students will be doing in their junior or senior year.
<br>
<br>
Creative Technologies is <i>a project-based curriculum where learners study the theoretical and social context of their projects and half of 
the studentsâ€™ study time is allocated for laboratory work developing new ideas or working on a range of projects to apply their ideas to 
different fields.</i>
<br>
<br>
Since Creative Technologies is a TLE subject, it is geared toward the development of technological proficiency and is anchored on 
knowledge and information, entrepreneurial concepts, process and delivery, work values, and life skills. <u>This means that it is built on 
adequate mastery of knowledge and information, skills and processes, and the acquisition of proper work values and life skills. 
It equips students with skills for lifelong learning.</u> It is founded on the cognitive, behavioral, or psychomotor and affective dimensions 
of human development.
<br>
<br>
Just like the TLE Framework, entrepreneurial concepts also form part of the foundation. It is expected that the learners will imbibe the 
entrepreneurial spirit and consequently set up their own businesses.
<br>
<br>
TLE by its nature is dominantly a skill subject; hence the teacher must engage students in an experiential, contextualized, and authentic
 teaching-learning process. It is a subject in which students learn best by doing. It is integrative in approach. For instance, 
it integrates entrepreneurship with all the areas of TLE. It integrates concepts, skills, and values.</p>
